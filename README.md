# Klipper-Pressure-Advance-Test

Thanks to [oderwat](https://github.com/oderwat) for creating this gcode.
Gathered from https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper/issues/361

The first file is from PA 0 to 0.63. The second is from .63 to 1.2 and is likely only needed if you have a bowden extruder.

**Don't forget to change the code at the beginning for auto bed leveling & desired temps**
